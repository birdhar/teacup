        <h2>Black Tea</h2>
        <h6>Black tea is a true tea, as it is more oxidized than oolong, green and white teas. It is generally stronger in flavour than the less oxidized teas.The reason was after the leaves are picked, they are fully oxidized, or exposed to oxygen. When the desired level of oxidation is reached, the process is halted by exposing the leaves to heat.
          The result is a tea that is rich, robust, and tannic in flavor. Black teas are processed in either of two ways, CTC (Crush, Tear, Curl) or Orthodox. Orthodox processing requires that the leaves be first withered and then rolled before oxidation. resulting tea more expensive. CTC process uses machinery to cut, tear and curl the leaves before they are oxidized.
        CTC processed black tea is best for strong brews like masala chai so this tea we find most often sold in bags.</h6>

      <div class="item1">
        <h2>Green Tea</h2>
        <h6>Green tea is made from the leaves from Camellia sinensis that have undergone minimal oxidation during processing. Pan-firing the leaves results in a lighter, almost toasted flavor while steaming the leaves creates a more vegetal, brisk brew.
          Unlike black tea, it tea is either steamed or pan-fired as quickly as possible after harvest to preserve its original qualities.
          It was initially originated in China, but it has become associated with many cultures throughout Asia. Popular Chinese green tea varieties include Long Jing, or Dragon Well, and Liu An Gua Pian, or Melon seed.
          Where as the most common green tea variety in Japan are Sencha and matcha. Between the two countries, the main differences are that
          Chinese growing methods rely more on the natural terroir to impart both character and flavor, while Japanese methods are more controlled.</h6>

        <h2>White Tea</h2>
        <h6>White tea is a particularly delicate variety of tea, as it’s harvested before the plant’s leaves are fully open. It is a lightly oxidized tea grown and harvested primarily in China, mostly in the Fujian and Zhejiang province.
        Now it is grown in Taiwan, India, Northern Thailand and Eastern Nepal.  Processing time of white tea is also short as it is neither rolled nor heavily oxidized. It also takes great care take great care to dry the leaves in both heat and moisture.
        When brewed, it carries a light, fresh flavor and is yellow in color. It doesn’t get its name from its color when brewed but instead “white tea” derives from the fine silvery-white hairs on the unopened buds of the tea plant, which gives the plant a whitish appearance. </h6>

      <div class="item1">
        <h2>Oolong Tea</h2>
        <h6>Oolong tea, also known as wu long cha is a semi-fermented tea. is a traditional Chinese tea produced through picking, withering, kneading, fermenting, and baking, which absorbs the making methods of green tea and red tea,
          hence giving this kind of tea the fresh and flower fragrance of green tea and mellow taste of black tea. Most unique part of this tea is the wide range of oxidation it is exposed to, which normally runs anywhere from 8 to 80 percent.
           It is also called “beauty tea” in Japan because of its brilliant effect on losing weight and anti-aging. The key factor in distinguishing between
          oolong varieties is whether their leaves have been rolled or twisted. Typically, those which are rolled will be lighter in flavor and greener in color. Where as twisted oolong varieties are less commonly found but they steep easier and faster</h6>

        <h2>Pu-erh Tea</h2>
        <h6>Pu-erh tea or pu’er tea is a unique type of fermented tea that’s traditionally made in the Yunnan Province of China. Although there are other types of fermented tea,
          pu-erh tea is different because the leaves themselves are fermented rather than the brewed tea. It is made from the leaves and stems of the
          large-leaf Assamica variety of the Camellia sinensis plant. This is the same plant that is used for making green, oolong, and black teas.
          There are two main categories of pu-erh tea,
          known as sheng, or raw pu-erh, and shou, or ripe pu-erh. After harvesting, the processing of pu-erh tea involves two stages.
          During the first stage, the tea leaves are prepared similar to green tea At second stage, the leaves undergo fermentation and then prolonged storage, or "aging," under high humidity.
         Pu-erh tea is populraly used for improving mental alertness and sharp thinking.</h6>

        <h2>Pu-erh Tea</h2>
        <h6>Herbal tea is not technically a true tea, as it does not derive from the Camellia sinensis plant
          (i.e. the plant that is used to create black, oolong, green, and white teas). Instead, herbal tea is an infusion or blend of various leaves, fruits, bark, roots, or flowers belonging to almost any edible, non-tea plant.
          Herbal teas are not only enjoyed for their flavor and aroma but their medicinal qualities as well.
          Because they can be created from almost any combination of natural ingredients, there are a vast number of herbal tea
          varieties Each with their own flavor qualities and health benefits. Popular varieties of herbal tea include Mint tea, Chamomile tea, Red rooibos tea, Ginger tea, Hibiscus tea, Peppermint tea, Spearmint tea and yerba mate tea.</h6>
